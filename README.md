# Pokedex Vue

It's a project made to practice the Vue concepts and learn how to consume a public API to build dynamic websites.

It still has some features to be added, CSS bugs to be fixed and optimizations, but implementing a search and pagination has made me understand important concepts for future projects and implementing a Figma design was great way to practice CSS.

## Demo
