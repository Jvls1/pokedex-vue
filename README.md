# Pokedex Vue

Its a project made to practice the Vue concepts and learn how to consume a public API 
to build dynamic web sites.

Still have some features to add, CSS bugs to fix and optimizations, but implement 
a search and pagination teach me some cool things about how they work on the 
client side, and implement a Figma design was great to practice CSS.
